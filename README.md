## utilities
### UPC to ASIN

#### what

converts list of UPCs or a single UPC to ASIN

#### why

On `Send To Amazon` page, while creating shipment plans, you can search by SKU, Title, ASIN and FNSKU for the products you want to ship.

![alt text](./static/upc-to-asin-1.jpg)

Guess what is missing? UPC!!!!!!!!!!!!

So whenever my brother sends a three page invoice to me like "create shipments for this", I have to do this 
```
switch tab -> fba inventory -> search with upc -> copy asin -> switch tab -> send to amazon -> search with asin -> enter quantity
```
for every single product.

`upc-to-asin` simplifies this process just to
```
send to amazon -> search with asin -> enter quantity
```
(dw, there is another command for creating shipment plans and skipping this process too)

#### how

single upc, for debugging purposes
```bash
halycon upc-to-asin --single --input 754603373000 -vvv
```
for list of upcs
```bash
halycon upc-to-asin --input list.txt --output out.txt
```
where list is newline delimited (one per line) text file
```bash
754603337000
...
```
output will be in same format.
```bash
B07H2WGKVB
...
```

### ASIN to SKU

#### why
for creating shipment plans, you need, SKU and ASIN's.
#### how

single asin, for debugging purposes
```bash
halycon asin-to-sku --single --input B07H2WGKVB -vvv
```
for list of asins
```bash
halycon asin-to-sku -vvv --input out.txt --output out.csv  
```
where input is list of ASIN's
```bash
B07H2WGKVB
...
```
and output will be
```
ASIN,SKU,Product Name,Quantity
B07H2WGKVB,some_sku,"Aneco 6 Pairs Over Knee Thigh Socks Knee-High Warm Stocking Women Boot Sock Leg Warmer High Socks for Daily Wear, Cosplay",
```
fill the quantity column and move on to `Shipments from SKU Data`


### Shipments from SKU Data

#### how
```bash
halycon shipment create -i sku.csv -v
```
where the input is the output of `asin-to-sku` command
```
ASIN,SKU,Product Name,Quantity
B07H2WGKVB,some_sku,"Aneco 6 Pairs Over Knee Thigh Socks Knee-High Warm Stocking Women Boot Sock Leg Warmer High Socks for Daily Wear, Cosplay",5
```

so for creating a shipment from list of UPCs (which is one of the main goals here), usual workflow is
```bash
halycon upc-to-asin      -i upc.txt -o asin.txt
halycon asin-to-sku      -i asin.txt -o sku.csv
halycon shipment create  -i sku.csv -v
```
after this, operation and workflow ID will be displayed
```bash
2:40AM INF success! inbound_plan_id=wf00a0e0a5-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX operation_id=78200213-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```
then, if requested, `https://sellercentral.amazon.com/fba/sendtoamazon/confirm_content_step?wf=wf00a0e0a5-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX` will open with default browser for confirming and finalizing the shipment on dashboard.

if you see the error `Please review SKUs with errors or unconfirmed SKUs` on dashboard, check the operation status.
```bash
halycon shipment operation status -i 78200213-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -v
```
which will give you the status, if success or in progress, message will be displayed with `INFO` level, so you may not see anything.
```bash
2:40AM INF id=78200213-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX status=SUCCESS
```
if operation failed, problems will be displayed line by line
```bash
halycon shipment operation status -i 0aa45ad9-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
2:34AM WRN id=0aa45ad9-XXXX-XXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX status=FAILED
2:34AM WRN problem 1 code=FBA_INB_0049 details="There's an input error with the resource 'SU-XXXX-XXXX'." severity=ERROR
```

### Search Product Type Definitions
#### why 
amazon name (product type) is required for [`PUT /listings/2021-08-01/items/{sellerId}/{sku}`](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/lang-tr_TR/docs/listings-items-api-v2021-08-01-reference#listingsitemputrequest)
#### how

```bash
#     --item string            The title of the ASIN to get the product type recommendation. Note: Cannot be used with keywords
#     --keywords stringArray   A comma-delimited list of keywords to search product types. Note: Cannot be used with itemName.
halycon definition search --keywords wallet
```
```
+--------------+-------------+
| DISPLAY NAME | AMAZON NAME |
+--------------+-------------+
| Wallet       | WALLET      |
+--------------+-------------+
```
### Get Product Type Definitions
#### why
attributes are required for [`PUT /listings/2021-08-01/items/{sellerId}/{sku}`](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/lang-tr_TR/docs/listings-items-api-v2021-08-01-reference#listingsitemputrequest)
#### how
```bash
halycon definition get --type WALLET -v
```
